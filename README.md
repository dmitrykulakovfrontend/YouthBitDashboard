Created on 2023-02-15 20:34:03.140186

Welcome to your [Plotly Dash](https://plotly.com/dash/) App!

See [Faculty.ai](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/examples/) for more information.

## Install and Setup

To start working on our app, you'll want to make sure you are using a virtual environment, so you can manage your packages properly.
To create an environment, install requirements, and run the app, use the following:

```bash
python -m venv .venv                            # create virtual environment
.venv\Scripts\pip install -r requirements.txt   # install requirements
.venv\Scripts\python src\app.py                 # run the application
```
